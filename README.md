## User Validation Form

I used PHPâ€™s OOP (object oriented programming) to create a user validator class. This class validates a username and an email that is input by the user. 

After the user has input the data into the form the PHP class takes the data, validates it, and outputs an error to the browser (if any occur). If the form passes validation it is ready to send the data to the database.

I have not connected this form to a database as it is just a project in PHP class development. This project has helped me better understand PHP classes by implementing one for a real-life operation.
